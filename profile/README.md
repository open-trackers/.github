# Open Trackers

This project presently consists of applications and their dependent
packages:

* [_Gym Routine Tracker_](https://open-trackers.github.io/grt/)
  - a minimalist gym workout tracker
* [_Daily Calorie Tracker_](https://open-trackers.github.io/dct/)
  - a minimalist calorie tracker

(Both available as free downloads for the Apple Watch, iPhone, and iPad.)

## Features

* Convenient and quick interactions to achieve the basic needs of the
  user. 

* A simpler alternative to the highly-capable (and sometimes
  overly-complex) apps found on the App Store. 

* Open-source with free and weak ‘copy-left’ licensing (MPL-2.0) to
  encourage long-term community development and support.

* Free to download from the App Store and use, building a community of
  users.

* A watch-first design focus, to encourage the wearable lifestyle.

* Respect for the user’s privacy (see the
  [policy](https://open-trackers.github.io/privacy/)).

* Data mobility, where the user can conveniently export their data for
  review.

* Leverages the Apple platform to provide sophisticated capabilities with
  minimal code.

* Shared code between _Tracker_ projects to ease maintenance, the
  development of new tracker apps, and to provide a consistent user
  interface.

## Participation

**The most important thing anyone can do now is to rate and review the
apps in the App Store. Preferably favorably! :)**

Future tracker apps might be possible, if good ideas emerge.

Adding features to existing tracker apps may be possible. Suggest features
in the ‘Issues’ for project.

Bug fixes are definitely needed and welcome! (Post details as a issue in
the relevant project.)

## Contributions

The code is licensed with MPL-2.0 and where the copyright is held by
@reedes’s OpenAlloc LLC. 

Contributions can be under the developer’s name or organization, but must
have a compatible license, preferably MPL-2.0.

(This should probably be expanded to a proper policy.)
